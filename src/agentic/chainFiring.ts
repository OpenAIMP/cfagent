/**
 * Issue #1517 ([AGENTIC] Lane 1, follow-up of #1362) — firing /
 * materialization wiring.
 *
 * This module wires Phase 3 synthesis to Phase 6 governance; it
 * invents NO new predicate, NO new execution, and NO new job model:
 *
 *  - Materialization: an APPROVED recurring synthesized record
 *    becomes a ScheduledAgent DO goals-list entry. Approval alone
 *    still creates nothing (the Phase 3 pin); only the explicit
 *    `ScheduledAgent.materializeSynthesizedSchedule` call does, via
 *    `materializeSynthesizedRecord` here. The entry's id IS the
 *    synthesized record's id, so the firing path can look the record
 *    up by goal id with no second mapping store. Its operation is
 *    `chain.execute` (a ScheduledAgent-owned marker in the
 *    OPERATION_CATALOG, in the same precedent as `social.publish` /
 *    `pipeline:social-daily`: the catalog entry exists so the goal
 *    is a valid goals-list entry, and `onCron` handles it in its own
 *    branch — it is not a generic orchestrator operation, and it is
 *    not a leg an orchestrator plan executes).
 *  - Firing decision: `decideChainFiring` is a thin reason-carrying
 *    wrapper over the Phase 6 contract `shouldFireGoverned` — the
 *    boolean it returns IS that predicate's boolean, never a
 *    re-implementation. Pending, killed, globally-halted, not-due,
 *    and already-consumed records never fire.
 *  - One-shot records have no cron, so they cannot become goals-list
 *    entries; they fire only through the direct
 *    `ScheduledAgent.fireSynthesizedSchedule` path, which uses the
 *    same decision function.
 *  - Execution honesty (lane boundary): a governed-true firing in
 *    this lane creates an orchestrator job descriptor exactly as
 *    every other scheduled goal does in `onCron` — it does NOT
 *    submit the chain as `mas_async_jobs` / #1355 shards and does
 *    NOT claim a chain run completed. Leg execution / shard
 *    submission is the next lane (chain.run executor). Because there
 *    is no run outcome yet, this lane writes NO `mas_adaptation_audit`
 *    row for a successful firing; the shipped #755 path IS used for
 *    blocked attempts (`auditBlockedChainFiring`), where the outcome
 *    ("blocked") is a true statement. A sql-carrying caller supplies
 *    the halt state via `shouldFireGoverned`'s `halted` option (or a
 *    sql for `isGovernedHalted`); the bare ScheduledAgent tick
 *    carries no Orchestrator `mas_settings` sql — its own DO SQLite
 *    is a different database — so a global halt thrown in the
 *    Orchestrator does not automatically stop a bare tick. That
 *    cross-DO halt read is a disclosed follow-up, not faked here by
 *    reading the wrong database.
