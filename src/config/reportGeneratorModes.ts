/**
 * #1731 (parent #1717, slice (k)): report generator remainders
 * (scan appendix (k) findings R-1, R-2, R-3, R-7, S1; R-4, R-5, R-6
 * IDENTICAL, pin only; R07 resolved into R-1..R-7; S2 IDENTICAL) —
 * the PAYMENTS_FLOW_MODE (#1711) / MARKET_DATA_* (#1727) /
 * GOAL_COMPILE_MODE (#1729) pattern applied to this domain, with
 * one deliberate difference, following the #1730 precedent: this
 * slice adds NO runtime switch. Pure module: no Cloudflare
 * imports, no I/O, no network — the registry is data, and the
 * tests in tests/report_generator_remainders_modes_1731.test.ts
 * pin the behavior distinctions it records (port-first, cfagent
 * blueprint #1795/#1798 restated wording: cloud-native but
 * cloud-agnostic).
 *
 * WHY NO SWITCH (read before adding one): every divergent pair
 * in appendix (k) is divergent-by-design, and a switch over any
 * of them would be either a silent misrender, a broken caller
 * contract, a stranded approval, or a phantom switch with no
 * single call site that could honor both values. The #1729 /
 * #1730 precedent governs: where a pair is divergent-by-design
 * for safety, or the two semantics genuinely differ and neither
 * is a legacy accident, pin it with justification rather than
 * forcing a phantom switch. Each pin below names the flip that
 * must NOT happen and why. A future slice that finds a genuine
 * single call site with both paths present must add its switch
 * here (and grow REPORT_GENERATOR_1731_SWITCHES) with its own
 * Red evidence — it must not silently flip a pin.
 *
 * Consequences of having no switch in this slice:
 * - There is NO env var to declare (src/types.ts untouched),
 *   NO production value for the owner to set, and NO
 *   config_error event: there is no switch value that could
 *   fail closed. The scoped resolution order (run > session >
 *   user > global env > built-in) has nothing to resolve here;
 *   each pin's `defaultBehavior` IS the current public-route
 *   behavior, recorded explicitly so the owner can overturn
 *   any pin later by a deliberate decision, not by a flag.
 * - No endpoint is removed, no code path is deleted, no store
 *   is merged, no new store/engine is introduced. NEVER
 *   EITHER/OR is honored by keeping both paths in every pair.
 * - The security guard holds trivially and absolutely: no
 *   caller can configure away any enforcement through this
 *   module, because this module configures nothing. IAAA gate
 *   switches, if any are ever touched here, stay
 *   admin/platform-controlled, default fail-closed, never
 *   user/session-configurable by the gated subject.
 *
 * The ONE executable change in this slice (not a switch): the
 * single dispatch in unifiedReportPipeline.ts now refuses
 * unknown report types loudly instead of silently rendering
 * them through the options branch — the #1641-class silent
 * misrender, completed. A goal-screen type through the dispatch
 * is therefore impossible by accident: it must use its pinned
 * direct path, or gain an explicit pipeline type in a future
 * slice. Typed callers are unaffected: the asset owner accepts
 * only the three pipeline types, and the dispatch is its only
 * caller.
 *
 * Switch-vs-pin table ("pinned" = divergent-by-design, both
 * paths kept; "identical" = already a single path, collapsed,
 * no switch; "resolved" = not a pair at all):
 * | pair | resolution | the flip that must NOT happen            |
 * | R-1  | pinned     | one merged renderer for all report types |
 * | R-2  | pinned     | goal-screen through the pipeline, or its |
 * |      |            | direct path deleted                      |
 * | R-3  | pinned     | one orchestration forcing one key /      |
 * |      |            | verification contract on both callers    |
 * | R-7  | pinned     | deleting the legacy shim on a date, or   |
 * |      |            | routing legacy rows via the canonical    |
 * |      |            | path (no stored copy exists for them)    |
 * | S1   | pinned     | merging the two research engines, or one |
 * |      |            | provenance vocabulary for both           |
 * | R-4  | identical  | a second canonical store (the wrapper IS |
 * |      |            | the store; id schemes are caller-level)  |
 * | R-5  | identical  | a second blob seam (key families are     |
 * |      |            | caller choices, not store divergence)    |
 * | R-6  | identical  | a second semantic index (one index path, |
 * |      |            | one search path)                         |
 * | R07  | resolved   | re-reporting the routes carry-over as a   |
 * |      |            | separate pair (it is R-1..R-7)            |
 * | S2   | identical  | a second screening engine (plan + ledger |
 * |      |            | orchestration over the one pipeline)     |
 *
 * Scan-vs-code verification (current main governs; the scan
 * head was 23de3ce, this slice verified against main f523bf2):
 * - Renderer sizes hold: screener 411 lines, options 253,
 *   research 361. Margins hold (36pt vs 48pt/48pt), wrap holds
 *   (screener + research word-wrap, options truncates to 120
 *   chars with no wrap), glyph cleaning holds (screener full
 *   set incl. triangle marks, options the same minus the
 *   triangles, research none).
 * - The routing claim holds: the single dispatch is the only
 *   production caller of the three renderers (pinned by the
 *   #1023 single-PDF-path source test), and the asset owner
 *   reaches the renderers only through that dispatch.
 * - Goal-screen deltas hold: own pagination at y below 56,
 *   100-hit cap, Yahoo-fallback provenance line, per-format
 *   REPORT_001 with the run still succeeding, key family
 *   goal_screen with R2 goals mapping. The asset owner's
 *   accepted types are exactly the three pipeline types.
 * - Tabular deltas hold: the screener agent keeps per-run +
 *   latest keys; the shard executor keeps a single per-run
 *   key, explicit content types, and read-back verification
 *   before the canonical row. The underlying XLSX/CSV
 *   generators are already shared per type.
 * - Confirm branches hold: kind screener resubmits the held
 *   follow-up delivery; rows with a stored id deliver the
 *   canonical copy; legacy rows deliver from the embedded
 *   payload. Same audit names, stored id vs file name and
 *   sheets count; missing stored maps to 500, email
 *   unavailable to 503, webhook unconfigured to 503 vs
 *   webhook failure to 502.
 * - S1 engines hold: the market-data single-symbol service and the
 *   governed ResearchAgent pipeline, different inputs,
 *   engines, stores, and provenance vocabularies, no shared
 *   report builder between them.
 * - R-4/R-5/R-6 hold: the ORM canonical method literally
 *   calls the scheduled store function; the blob seam maps
 *   screener, options, goal-screen, and knowledge families;
 *   the semantic index has one index path and one search
 *   path, served by the semantic-search route.
 * - Scope note: S2 is appendix-(k) finding #10 and is NOT
 *   enumerated in the #1731 issue body (which lists R-1, R-2,
 *   R-3, R-7, S1 plus R-4/R-5/R-6 pin-only and R07 resolved).
 *   It is recorded here as IDENTICAL so this slice covers all
 *   10 appendix-(k) pairs; its subject is goal-screen
 *   orchestration, not a report generator, and no code is
 *   touched for it either way.
