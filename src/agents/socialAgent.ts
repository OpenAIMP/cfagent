/**
 * #1077 Phase 4 + Phase 5a — SocialMediaAgent.
 *
 * Phase 4 (drafts-only skeleton):
 * - buildDailyDrafts composes and stores drafts, then stops.
 * - publishDraft refuses every attempt with not_implemented_phase5.
 *   It stays as the Phase 4 placeholder; publishDueDrafts below is
 *   the Phase 5a path and does not call it.
 *
 * Phase 5a (token-independent publish gating):
 * - publishDueDrafts publishes the drafts that are DUE for a date:
 *   approval-list drafts only when status is "approved" — or when
 *   status is "dry-run-posted" WITH its approval record (an approved
 *   draft keeps its approval standing through a dry-run publish,
 *   #1171); autonomous drafts when status is "draft", "approved",
 *   or "dry-run-posted" (approval never blocks an autonomous
 *   channel). Posted/failed drafts are never republished.
 * - Publication resolves per channel through publisher.ts: dry-run by
 *   default; live only when posting is on, SOCIAL_LIVE_PUBLISHING is
 *   "1"/"true", and the channel token (and account id, where
 *   required) is present. A failed live gate is an error entry, never
 *   a silent dry-run fallback.
 * - Per-channel failures are error entries, never throws, never
 *   blocking other channels. A failed publish attempt leaves the draft
 *   in its pre-publish status for a later retry — it is NOT marked
 *   failed (only an explicit rejectDraft does that).
 * - "posted" means REALLY posted (#1171): a dry-run publish sets
 *   status "dry-run-posted" and records nothing on the draft, so
 *   flipping live mid-day still live-publishes that day's drafts;
 *   a live publish sets status "posted" and records the platform
 *   post id on the draft. A dry-run sweep skips already
 *   dry-run-posted drafts (no double sink record). The result
 *   outcome vocabulary ("posted" for a publish this sweep made) is
 *   unchanged, so goal fired/catch-up accounting is unaffected.
 *
 * Hard rules (unchanged from Phase 4):
 * - Posting disabled (SOCIAL_POSTING_ENABLED off) → early return
 *   "postingDisabled"; nothing is written.
 * - No brief (missing, empty, or whitespace-only) → early return
 *   "noBrief"; nothing is written. The agent NEVER invents placeholder
 *   content: without a brief there are no drafts, full stop.
 * - One draft per enabled channel (autonomous list + approval list),
 *   written idempotently: a second build the same day returns the first
 *   draft set, never duplicates.
 * - Channel disposition follows the fail-closed resolution in
 *   social/config.ts (both lists → approval; unknown → approval).
 * - Unknown configured channels produce an error entry, never a draft,
 *   and never throw.
