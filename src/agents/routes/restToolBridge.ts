/**
 * #1644 (parent #1638, doc §8): the REST → IMcpToolCommand bridge.
 *
 * Reduced REST handlers execute through the command registry instead of
 * re-implementing the query: one execution path per command, with the
 * route keeping only transport concerns (body/query parsing, REST-contract
 * defaults, response shaping, error-status mapping) and its position in
 * routeRequest's sequential matching (auth/session unchanged).
 *
 * Two context shapes, one rule: a command reduced here MUST NOT read
 * context.env or context.facade (verified per command in the #1644 issue
 * map). Commands that need the facade (e.g. get_payment_gateways) go
 * through executeMCPTool from src/mcps/openaimp/index.ts, which builds a real
 * McpSystemFacade from the route's env — see payments.ts. This bridge is
 * for the env-free commands only, so route contexts that carry no env
 * (schema, ads/revenue, audit, memory) need no new required fields and
 * existing test literals keep typechecking.
