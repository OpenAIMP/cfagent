/**
 * Cloudflare Slack Trading Agent.
 *
 * This class keeps the Agents SDK surface (the export pin in
 * tests/dead-agent-classes.test.ts, the /health endpoint, the #147
 * signature gate, and the /transaction-snap trigger) and the two
 * delegation helpers external code calls (sendPreTradeApprovalTicket,
 * dispatchTransactionSnap). It no longer parses Slack payloads
 * itself: slash commands, events, and interactions all delegate to
 * the single service, ETradeSlackTradingService — the duplicate
 * handleSlashCommand / handleInteraction implementations were
 * retired in #1262 Phase 2 (they ran NLQ under the DO instance id
 * with no principal resolution or tier gates, and double-dispatched
 * transaction snaps after approvals).
 *
 * Issue #2412 (Agent Mesh S13, G10): Slack ingress is ONE
 * implementation. Production ingress runs src/server.ts routes →
 * OrchestratorAgent instances named slack_<teamId> →
 * handleTradingIntegrationsRoutes (src/agents/routes/
 * tradingIntegrations.ts) → the service. This class's onRequest
 * previously carried a parallel ingress (its own principal
 * resolution and a service construction with NO NLQ dep set, so
 * behavior differed by entry point); it now delegates the same
 * three payload shapes to the same handler with an agent-hosted
 * route context (tradingRouteContext below), so the gate, the
 * principal resolution, the NLQ dep set, the event dedup, and the
 * service are identical on both hosts. The production host stays
 * the orchestrator instance because the channel's NLQ dep set is
 * host-bound: the scheduling port binds the host class's own
 * schedule-callback methods (which exist only on
 * OrchestratorAgent), the discovery stores are built over the host
 * instance's storage, and the approval draft ledger lives in the
 * host instance's ORM. On THIS host the scheduling port therefore
 * refuses honestly (see refusingNlqSchedulingPort) rather than
 * registering schedules whose callbacks this class cannot run.
 * The SLACK_AGENT DO binding exists since #2215; the class's first
 * production instantiation is its A2A door — handleA2A below,
 * #2223 — and chat reaches its outbound helpers through the G1
 * door (#2351).
 *
 * Issue #1960 (think-fleet): migrated from AIChatAgent to PortThink
 * (src/actors/thinkAdapter.ts). Chat-surface mapping, verified from
 * this file and its tests: the class defines no onChatMessage /
 * onChatResponse / onChatError / getModel / getSystemPrompt / getTools
 * and drives no AI chat turn — its "chat" is Slack webhook ingress
 * (commands, interactions, events) in onRequest below, delegating to
 * ETradeSlackTradingService, plus the two domain helpers. AIChatAgent's
 * WS chat-request path therefore only ever reached its default
 * onChatMessage, which throws; Think's native WS chat (runTurn with
 * Think defaults) replaces that throwing stub. The get-messages
 * onRequest intercept maps too: AIChatAgent returned its stored
 * transcript JSON, Think returns Response.json(this.messages) — and
 * this class writes to neither store, so both are empty in practice.
 * No port hooks object exists to keep (none were defined) and no
 * adapter turn is wired: inventing a model/tools/prompt would be new
 * behavior, not a preserved turn path. PortThink.portHooks stays
 * unset, so a direct Think turn uses Think defaults.
