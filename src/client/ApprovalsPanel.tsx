/**
 * Issue #1705 (A3-c, finding 1, incremental step only): one top-level
 * Approvals surface composing the existing approval queues — no queue
 * capability is removed or reimplemented here. Trade drafts live in
 * TradingApprovalsQueue (#1327); held deliveries live in
 * PendingReviewQueue (#1324). Each queue keeps its own loading,
 * decision, and refresh behavior; this surface only composes them so
 * every consequential action awaiting a decision is findable in one
 * place. Schedule and social approvals have no listable
 * pending-decision endpoint, so there is nothing to compose for them
 * yet — the scope note below says so rather than implying a third
 * queue exists. A full goal-oriented workspace redesign is explicitly
 * out of scope (needs Ceos's program decision).
 *
 * UX token architecture compliance is mandatory with no exemptions
 * (ADR-0004): the panel's own chrome is the PageShell primitive, and every
 * control on the surface comes from the primitive-built queues.
