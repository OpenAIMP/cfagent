/**
 * Issue #2208 — referral-credit service: the earn event and the
 * coverage-path redemption.
 *
 * Earn: a referred user's FIRST paid run earns the referrer the
 * stored rule amount (read from the operator rule row at earn
 * time, so a rule change affects future earnings only). The
 * port's recordEarning is idempotent per referred user, so a
 * replayed earn event cannot double-earn.
 *
 * Attribution gap, stated plainly: no signup/submit path today
 * records which referrer a user came from (referral LINKS exist
 * in ads/referrals tracking, but no referrer attribution lands
 * on the account). The operator record-earn route is therefore
 * the earn trigger in this slice; wiring automatic attribution
 * (referral code captured at account creation, earn fired on
 * first verified paid run) is follow-up work, not claimed here.
 *
 * Redemption and the coverage path: referral credits are NOT
 * spent by starting a run directly — that would be a parallel
 * payment bypass around the gate. Instead, conversion settles
 * referral credit INTO the commercial account (adjustCredits),
 * and the run then goes through the EXISTING gate + payment
 * workflow, which covers it via paidVia "credits" and consumes
 * it via the existing consumeCoverage path. Zero gate changes,
 * zero new paidVia values, zero price changes. The referral
 * ledger keeps the audit (which earnings were redeemed, for
 * which run); the commercial balance is only ever topped up by
 * exactly the redeemed amount.
 *
 * Ordering (fail-safe direction): redeem the referral earnings
 * FIRST, then top up the commercial account. If the top-up
 * throws, the redeem already happened — the caller fails closed
 * (503, no run, no payment workflow) and the earning rows are
 * the operator's reconcile signal. The reverse order (top-up
 * first) would mint spendable commercial credit on a redeem
 * failure, which is strictly worse. Partial balances are NOT
 * converted: conversion covers an exact run price, and a
 * balance below the price stays untouched for a later run —
 * partial-balance discounting needs gate work and is deferred.
