/**
 * Monetization Phase 1.2 (#2408, sub-issue of #2405): metering
 * enforcement for the single user — the paid gate's meter + tier
 * helpers.
 *
 * The paid gate (ETradeAgenticPaymentService.handleGatedEndpoint)
 * serves a paid call only when the meter accepts it: after
 * fulfill, before serving, the gate inserts one usage_event into
 * the existing usage_events store (UsageEventPort) and refuses
 * with a typed error when the meter is missing or the insert
 * fails. This replaces the previously advisory posture ("metering
 * must not break the run", "the published result stands either
 * way" in researchPublish.ts) ON PAID PATHS ONLY — ungated/free
 * paths keep their existing behavior and never touch this module.
 *
 * Tier rule (fail-closed default, #1076):
 * - No resolver wired, or the resolver finds no stored tier, or
 *   the commercial store is unbound → "Free". Free is implicit
 *   (commercialPorts.toCommercialAccount) and grants nothing by
 *   itself; payment remains the entitlement evidence, so the
 *   default can never grant paid access.
 * - A resolved tier is validated with assertStoreTier: an invalid
 *   value is refused, never defaulted away silently.
 * - A tier-store read failure propagates to the gate, which
 *   refuses with a typed error (the money-path fail direction
 *   per createCommercialPorts.ts: fail-closed on money paths).
 * - Tier NEVER bypasses payment in this slice: a Subscribed
 *   included-run bypass at the premium gate is a slice-3 /
 *   Phase-2 decision, not invented here, and would grant paid
 *   access by tier value alone before the owner assigns any tier.
 *
 * #1819 rows-read lens: this module performs NO store read at
 * all. The meter insert is a single write through the caller's
 * port (no preceding read); tier resolution reads, when they
 * happen, live in the caller's resolver (premium routes: two
 * indexed D1 point reads on session traffic only, zero reads on
 * anonymous traffic) — never in SessionStore, never a scan.
 * This module is pure apart from the caller's port: labeling it
 * costs no per-request store read, exactly like slice 1's
 * x402PaymentPath helper.

 * The tier resolver is optional for the same reason: anonymous
 * (payer-bound) traffic has no session login to resolve, so no
 * resolver is wired and the tier defaults to Free with zero
 * store reads.
