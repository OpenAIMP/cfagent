// Issue #354 — pure fire/no-fire decision for folding the daily options
// research run into the "*/30" scheduled tick.
//
// Context: the account is at the Workers Free ceiling of 5 cron triggers
// per account (error 10072), so the dedicated "0 21 * * 1-5" trigger cannot
// exist and its server.ts branch is dead code. The daily run therefore rides
// the "*/30" tick, and must fire exactly once per weekday, at/after 21:00
// UTC (17:00 ET after market close).
//
// The "already fired today" input comes from durable state — the
// orchestrator's mas_settings row (survives across ticks AND isolates;
// an in-memory flag alone would not). This module stays pure (no SDK
// imports) so the decision is unit-testable without the Worker harness.
// All date/time math is in UTC, matching how cron triggers fire.

/** Earliest UTC hour of day at which the scheduled research run may fire. */
