/**
 * #1751 (parent #1717, IAAA-3): obligation/advice channel.
 *
 * Before this slice, authz.md §10 recorded obligations/advice as
 * partial equivalents only: audit-on-decision was a record, not a
 * condition, and step-up was enforced ad hoc at each gate, not
 * declared as an obligation attached to a policy. The PDP returned
 * allow/deny and everything else was the caller's job.
 *
 * This module is the channel. It has two halves, kept deliberately
 * separate the way XACML separates them:
 *
 * - POLICY: the frozen OBLIGATION_POLICY table. Obligations and
 *   advice attach to a PERMISSION, not to a gate call site, so every
 *   PEP that evaluates through this module enforces the same
 *   obligations for the same permission. A permission with no table
 *   entry behaves exactly as the PDP alone decides — the channel
 *   adds enforcement, it never re-decides policy.
 * - PEP ENFORCEMENT: evaluateWithObligations() wraps the PDP seam
 *   (checkPermission, iaaaPdpSeam.ts). On a PDP deny it returns the
 *   deny unchanged (with the PDP's reason) plus the policy's
 *   advice. On a PDP allow it enforces each declared obligation, in
 *   table order, BEFORE returning allow; any failure turns the
 *   decision into a deny with reason OBLIGATION_FAILED. Advice is
 *   delivered with allow and deny alike and never changes a
 *   decision — it is information, not enforcement.
 *
 * The two obligation kinds in v1 (the issue's acceptance minimum):
 * - "step-up": fresh authentication, via the real requiresStepUp
 *   rule (sessionPolicy.ts): authTimeMs must be finite, not in the
 *   future, and younger than the platform step-up freshness
 *   default. The window is DEFAULT_STEP_UP_FRESHNESS_MS (15
 *   minutes), REUSED not settled — it remains an open CISO value
 *   (#1757), exactly as #1750 reused the enforced defaults.
 * - "audit-before-allow": the injected audit writer must record
 *   the allow decision before allow is returned. This is audit as
 *   a CONDITION, not audit-on-decision: a missing writer, a false
 *   return, or a throwing writer all deny. The writer is injected
 *   (an interface, not a store): this module performs no I/O and
 *   uses no Cloudflare infrastructure, so no adapter is defined
 *   for it — the caller supplies whatever audit sink its surface
 *   already uses (the hash-chained iaaaAuditStore, or a test
 *   recorder). CAIO coordination: no CAIO-lane obligation port
 *   exists to consume or link; nothing is duplicated here.
 *
 * Fail-closed rules (the program's security guard, applied here):
 * - A missing authTimeMs, a future authTimeMs, or a non-finite one
 *   fails the step-up obligation. The obligation is never skipped
 *   for lack of context.
 * - A missing audit writer fails the audit obligation. The allow
 *   is never returned unaudited.
 * - An audit writer that returns false or throws fails the
 *   obligation. Channel unavailability denies; it never fails
 *   open to allow.
 * - An unknown obligation kind (defensive branch — unreachable
 *   from the frozen, typed table) denies rather than being
 *   ignored. Ambiguity fails closed.
 * - Obligations short-circuit in table order: a failed step-up
 *   never triggers an audit record for an action that will not
 *   happen.
 *
 * What this table deliberately is NOT:
 * - Not configuration. No env var, session value, run value, or
 *   user value can widen, narrow, or disable an obligation — there
 *   is no lookup of any kind in this module, on purpose. A
 *   caller-configurable obligation would let a caller disable
 *   their own enforcement, which the program's security guard
 *   forbids. The table is frozen at module load for the same
 *   reason. (Pin justification, NEVER EITHER/OR exception: there
 *   is no divergent pair here to keep — the ad-hoc gates this
 *   channel replaces were never a second contract, and keeping
 *   them as a switchable alternative would preserve exactly the
 *   ad-hoc enforcement the issue retires. The old gates are NOT
 *   deleted by this slice; they stay in place until CTO-lane #945
 *   route wiring adopts this evaluator route by route, and that
 *   migration is a named residual in authz.md §10, not a silent
 *   coexistence.)
 * - Not live route wiring. Like authorization.ts before it, this
 *   module is the PEP-side enforcement function, proved here
 *   against the real PDP seam; routes keep their current gates
 *   until the #945 wiring step adopts it (each adopting route
 *   must supply its session's authTimeMs and its audit sink).
 *   Changing live gates inside this slice — e.g. making
 *   integration:connect deny whenever its route lacks an audit
 *   writer — would be a behavior change with no route owner
 *   review, and is refused here on purpose.
 * - Not scope-qualified (v1). Obligations attach to the permission
 *   regardless of scope; scope-qualified entries are a future
 *   extension, not invented here.
