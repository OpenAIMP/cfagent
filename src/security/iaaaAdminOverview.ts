/**
 * #945 IAAA-UI v1 — read-only admin overview builder.
 *
 * What this module is: the single place that assembles the data for
 * GET /api/iaaa/overview from the existing stores, and the single
 * place that decides whether the caller may see it. It performs NO
 * store write of any kind (no put, append, grant, or revoke): the
 * route that calls it is GET-only, and v1 has no mutation path.
 *
 * Gating (fail-closed, server-side — the client never decides):
 * the caller must carry a wired session (internalUserId present;
 * legacy sessions have none) AND hold a live platform-admin
 * membership (role "platform-admin", scope "platform", not
 * revoked, not expired). Anything else gets { allowed: false }
 * with NO membership or audit data attached, so a 403 body can
 * never leak partial data.
 *
 * Trust assumption (documented, not hidden): the caller who passes
 * the gate IS a platform admin, so tenant-level audit data for the
 * resolved tenant is shown to them. Audit events are filtered to
 * the resolved tenant (tenantId === tenant) — a platform admin
 * still does not see other tenants' events from this route.
 *
 * Store limitations (read before extending this panel):
 * - There is NO list-all memberships API in MembershipStore
 *   (getMembershipsByUser only), so v1 shows the CALLER'S OWN
 *   memberships, not every user's. Cross-user listing goes
 *   through the #1758 list-all source (listMembershipsFromEntries
 *   over the sessions-namespace listing), which is what the
 *   #2173 admin-counts field on the overview route uses; the
 *   builder itself still never lists other users.
 * - The audit store is a single tenant-mixed log key
 *   (iaaa-audit:events) read in full and filtered in memory;
 *   at auth-event volume that is acceptable, but this route
 *   must NOT be used for per-request audit until a bounded
 *   backend exists (same limitation as the audit store itself).
 * - Membership/audit reads that throw (e.g. corrupt bytes, which
 *   the stores refuse to overwrite) propagate to the route,
 *   which answers 500 with a generic error and no partial data.
 * - The genesis marker is a single key per tenant
 *   (iaaa-bootstrap:platform-genesis:<tenant>); its presence
 *   means a platform-admin genesis has happened, not who holds
 *   the role — the membership list answers that.

 * surface that exposes identities to platform admins).
 *
 * Rules (fixed from the membership model in authorization.ts):
 * - A membership counts only when live: revokedAtMs undefined.
 *   There is no separate "retired" status; revocation is the
 *   status, and it is per membership.
 * - A binding counts only when live: expiresAtMs undefined or
 *   greater than nowMs.
 * - platformAdmins = DISTINCT internalUserIds holding a live
 *   platform-admin binding at platform scope. Platform scope is
 *   platform-wide, so the membership's tenant does not split
 *   this count.
 * - tenantAdminsByTenant = per tenant, DISTINCT internalUserIds
 *   holding a live tenant-admin binding at tenant scope in that
 *   tenant. An identity admin in two tenants counts in EACH
 *   tenant's count; tenantAdminsTotal is the SUM of the
 *   per-tenant counts, not distinct identities across tenants.
 * - An identity holding both a platform-admin binding and a
 *   tenant-admin binding counts in BOTH dimensions.
 * - member / workspace-admin / approver / auditor bindings never
 *   count, and scope mismatches (platform-admin at tenant scope,
 *   tenant-admin at platform scope) never count.
 * - Breakdown rows are sorted by tenantId for determinism.
