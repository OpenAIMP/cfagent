/**
 * Issue #2441 (program #2442 slice S2) — broker-dispatched token
 * rejection propagation.
 *
 * An upstream rejection is a fact about token state and must propagate
 * to the store that serves tokens: a consumer that silently re-serves a
 * rejected token holds a second truth about provider state. This module
 * is the dispatch point for that rule, shaped so the same handling
 * generalizes to any broker (owner broker-agnostic rule, 2026-10-30):
 * the caller names the broker, and exactly one branch per broker knows
 * how that broker's tokens are stored and dropped. S4 extends the
 * dispatch with the remaining brokers; it does not re-shape it.
 *
 * Today only "etrade" is implemented: the dead token is dropped from
 * every key scope the seam can reach (login variants, plus internal-id
 * and alias-login keys when identity is known) and the isolate cache is
 * invalidated, both via revokeStoredTokens — so the next read cannot
 * re-serve it. An unknown broker is a fail-closed no-op: handled false,
 * nothing touched, never another broker's tokens. A remote (upstream)
 * revoke is deliberately NOT attempted here: E*TRADE already rejected
 * the pair, so there is nothing live left to revoke upstream, and a
 * remote call would only add a failing request to an already-failed
 * read. Propagation itself never throws: a drop failure is recorded
 * and reported as dropped false, so it can never mask the original
 * upstream error or break the read path.
 *
 * Never logs token values — presence and key scope only.
