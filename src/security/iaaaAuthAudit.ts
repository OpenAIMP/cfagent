/**
 * #945 Wiring Phase 2a — auth audit event builders + best-effort recording.
 *
 * Builds Slice 5 IaaaAuditEvent inputs for authentication events and
 * records them through a caller-supplied AuditStore seam. This module
 * creates NO production store: the existing audit route and the
 * mas_events store are untouched. The builders take tenantId as an
 * explicit caller parameter and invent no default themselves. (The
 * GitHub end-to-end slice resolved the two open questions at the
 * call sites: the Kv-backed store in iaaaAuditStore.ts is the
 * backend, and server.ts resolves the tenant as IAAA_TENANT_ID else
 * the documented default "primary" — see iaaaGithubEndToEnd.ts.
 * Inventing any other tenant value would fabricate attribution.)
 *
 * Actor attribution: the actor is the Slice 1 internal user id when
 * known. When it is not known — a login that failed before any
 * binding existed — the actor is the literal string "unknown",
 * which states the absence of attribution rather than attributing
 * the event to a login, an email, or a guessed identity. A login
 * is never attributed by display login: logins can change, and
 * Slice 5 forbids login/email as identity.
 *
 * Best-effort recording, deliberately: `recordWiredAuthAudit`
 * never throws and its result never changes a login outcome in
 * this phase. Whether a failed audit write should BLOCK a wired
 * login (the Slice 5 consequential-action rule) is a CISO
 * decision still open, and blocking logins on a store that does
 * not exist in production yet would be the wrong default. The
 * caller that eventually wires a production store must decide
 * this explicitly and document it; until then, a failed write
 * is reported in the result, not enforced.
 *
 * Not yet audited here (Phase 2b): token-exchange / profile-fetch
 * failures in the wired callback (they fail before any binding
 * context exists). Logout IS hooked since Phase 2b-part1: the
 * hook lives in githubOAuth.ts handleLogout (reached from
 * server.ts /auth/logout) and records BEFORE deleteSession when
 * wiring is ON and the session has an internalUserId. Since
 * #1760, a legacy session logout (no internalUserId) records a
 * logout_audit_skipped event instead of silence, when an audit
 * store and tenant resolve. Login events are hooked since the
 * GitHub end-to-end slice: server.ts dispatch supplies the audit
 * store and the resolved tenant (IAAA_TENANT_ID else "primary")
 * to the wired callback, so login success/failure events are
 * recorded in production, best-effort.
 * Whether a failed audit write should BLOCK a wired login (the
 * Slice 5 consequential-action rule) is still an open CISO
 * decision — this slice does not block on audit failure.
