/**
 * Issue #1701 ([AGENTIC] Slice 6, retention enforcement) —
 * pure purge runner + governed job definition.
 *
 * No store client, no binding, no query language here: the
 * runner operates only on the RetentionPurgeStore port, so
 * the same code runs unchanged against the D1 adapter and
 * the in-memory adapter. The runner itself decides nothing
 * about any table except agent_shard_jobs — the port's
 * allowlist is the whole table surface.
 *
 * Phases, in order:
 *  1. Age: delete rows with createdAtMs strictly older than
 *     now - windowDays, oldest first, in bounded batches,
 *     until no aged row remains or the per-run cap stops it.
 *     A row exactly AT the cutoff survives (strict `<`,
 *     mirroring runStorageRetention).
 *  2. Cap: if the tenant still holds more than
 *     RETENTION_SHARD_JOB_CAP_ROWS rows, delete the oldest
 *     excess rows, oldest first, subject to the remaining
 *     per-run cap.
 * The runner is idempotent: a second run over the same
 * tenant prunes zero rows.
 *
 * Governed job: `runRetentionPurgeJob` is the job body an
 * operator activates (see RETENTION_PURGE_JOB). It skips
 * without purging when halted — the same fail-closed
 * direction as the tick — and a store failure is logged
 * and returned, never thrown into a firing path. The job
 * is single-tenant per invocation: the caller supplies the
 * tenant id (from IAAA resolution at activation time);
 * multi-tenant enumeration at activation is an operator
 * step, not something this module invents.
