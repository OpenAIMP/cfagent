/**
 * Issue #2362 (#1976 step 4f) — the quote-source setting port.
 *
 * The setting is the deployment-wide quote source pick from
 * issue #2108 (the WS + HTTP quote surfaces share one
 * Worker-level cache, so the pick is deployment-wide, not
 * per-user). The table's DDL authority is migration 0022
 * (src/data/migrationRunner.ts); before this slice the module
 * self-created it at runtime (step-4 audit R-8).
 *
 * DECLARED FAIL-OPEN (the port contract, previously an
 * ambient side effect of the legacy module): `get()` NEVER
 * throws and NEVER returns an error state. An absent store
 * (composition hands out a port whose reads land nowhere),
 * a missing table, a missing row, an invalid stored value,
 * or any store failure all resolve to "auto" — the legacy
 * env-driven behaviour. Writes are the opposite direction:
 * `set()` ensures the schema and upserts, and a store
 * failure on write propagates to the caller, because a
 * settings write that silently did not land would misreport
 * state to the operator who made it.
