/**
 * Issue #2288 (#1976 step 0, ADR 0022 D-F.2) — trace-record port.
 *
 * The unified trace substrate: one record per cross-agent call /
 * workflow step, in a D1-native family every agent can append to
 * and the intelligence loop (Sentinel #2279 first) can read —
 * the gap the survey recorded in §5.2 (mas_events is per-DO,
 * session-scoped, and carries no correlation fields; Analytics
 * Engine is fire-and-forget with no read port).
 *
 * Port-first (ADR 0002 R1/R2): this module carries record types,
 * the port interface, and pure helpers ONLY. It imports no store
 * client, references no env binding, and writes no SQL. Query
 * code lives in d1TraceRecordAdapter.ts; the in-memory adapter
 * shares this module's types so the two cannot drift. A
 * structural test pins the import rule.
 *
 * Append discipline (#1133, ADR 0022 D-F2): substrate writes
 * never throw into the caller's path. The port's appendTrace is
 * the writer-path operation and DOES throw (a caller who must
 * know uses it directly); `recordTraceSafely` is the discipline
 * wrapper every publication call site should use — it converts
 * a failed append into a recorded result carrying the stable
 * catalog code DATA_TRACE_APPEND_FAILED, mirroring
 * captureStore's never-throws + failure-marker semantics. The
 * gap is visible in the result, never silently swallowed.
 *
 * Attribution is two-part (G14): every record names the acting
 * agent AND the principal it acted for. Retention is gate G-4:
 * no retention line is encoded in this slice beyond the schema.
