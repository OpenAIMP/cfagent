/**
 * Issue #1737 — the workflow composition root. This is the
 * ONLY module (besides the provider adapter and the workflow
 * class) that touches the workflow binding: it reads the
 * binding out of the environment and builds the provider
 * adapter around it. Domain code imports this helper and the
 * port types, never a binding.
 *
 * Bindings (both required, both fail-open to legacy behavior):
 *  - SCREENER_WORKFLOW: the workflow binding. Absence means
 *    no workflow ports at all (null) — callers keep their
 *    legacy behavior (the synchronous screen).
 *  - AGENT_DB: the projection store. The workflow path
 *    records its job rows and journal through it; without it
 *    the path cannot report progress, so the composition
 *    root returns null rather than running blind. A provider
 *    workflow must never be silently replaced by the
 *    in-memory adapter in production — that would lie about
 *    durability — so the in-memory adapter is constructed
 *    explicitly by its users (tests, local development),
 *    never here.
