## 1. Evolutionary Vision & Maturity Continuum

The architectural evolution of the Cloudflare Agent Platform (`cfagent`) represents a progressive transition from human-directed micro-services to autonomous, self-optimizing agent networks, culminating in **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)** and **Artificial Superintelligence Readiness (ASI-R)** within strictly bounded financial and operational safety guardrails.

## 2. Stage Breakdown & Evolution Vectors

### Stage 1: Current Hybrid Baseline (Phases 1 & 2)

* **Architecture:** `OrchestratorAgent` delegates to `ResearchAgent` via DO RPC with deterministic service fallbacks (`researchPipeline`).
* **Governance:** Manual prompt engineering, deterministic service execution for screening and payments, and basic task ledger logging (`ResearchTaskLedger`).
* **Safety:** Hardcoded boundary tests blocking direct trade authorization or unverified payment transfers.

### Stage 2: Fully Agentic Workflow Matrix (Phase 3 Target)

* **Architecture:** Decentralized multi-agent domain mesh. `OrchestratorAgent` operates as a light gateway coordinator dispatching to specialized sub-agents (`Research`, `Screener`, `NLQ`, `Payments`) backed by universal task ledgers.
* **Governance:** Independent `Evaluator`/`Judge` agents automatically auditing task execution outputs against formal quality and risk rubrics.
* **Safety:** Deterministic pre-flight checks and cryptographic token validation gating all external side-effects.

### Stage 3: Adaptive Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) Framework

* **Architecture:** Agents dynamically evaluate execution performance, identifying prompt inefficiencies, context gaps, or tool routing bottlenecks.
* **Self-Optimization Mechanism:**
  * Agents generate candidate prompt or strategy modifications in isolated sandbox Durable Objects.
  * Modifications are evaluated by independent deterministic test suites (`npm run test:ci`, backtest evaluations).
  * Prompts meeting threshold improvements are committed to the `Model/Prompt Registry` with immutable versioning.
* **Safety & Non-Modifiable Boundaries (The Never-List):**
  1. No self-modification of financial risk limits, spending caps, or trading boundaries.
  2. No expansion of agent permissions or key generation authority.
  3. No alteration of evaluation rubrics or verification tests.
  4. No modification of security, IAAA, or break-glass access configurations.

### Stage 4: Artificial Superintelligence Readiness (ASI-R) Target

* **Architecture:** Highly parallelized, multi-agent consensus networks operating over global edge workers, performing continuous market hypothesis generation, real-time risk modeling, and multi-asset options strategy synthesis.
* **Alignment & Governance:**
  * **Constitutional Alignment Layer:** Immutable system prompts and cryptographic execution policies embedded directly into Durable Object state machines.
  * **Multi-Model Consensus:** Critical financial and analytical conclusions require quorum agreement across heterogeneous model architectures.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Circuit Breakers:** Real-time kill-switches and automated volatility/risk circuit breakers capable of revoking agent session keys instantly.

The page-shell standard (#1804, S1–S4, completed) is the standing
anti-drift control for SPA structure: one route table as the single
source of truth for navigation, one `PageShell` primitive as the route
outlet wrapper, composition over monoliths. Its conformance list
(`tests/shell_conformance_1804.json`, 25 of 26 — `chat` deferred per
ADR-0021) is the registry that makes structural drift visible instead
of silent. Home doc: `docs/architecture/UX/design-system-01.md`.

2. **Evaluator Pass Rate:** Ratio of research and screening reports passing independent deterministic Judge evaluation on first pass.
3. **RSI Prompt Efficiency Gain:** Measured reduction in token consumption and execution latency for self-optimized prompts.
4. **Zero Safety Drift:** 100% compliance record on automated security policy gates and zero violations of trading or payment boundaries.
