/**
 * Issue #2065: goal-workflow start fails in production with a generic 500.
 *
 * The start path had two diagnosability defects and one repair gap:
 *  - a failed `create` followed by a failed adoption `get` discarded the
 *    provider error, so the only trace was "start_failed";
 *  - the route could not say WHICH dependency was missing;
 *  - an unusable derived instance id (over the provider's 100-char ceiling
 *    or rejected characters) could never start, even though a shorter id
 *    would have worked.
 *
 * Pins here:
 *  - the composition root names the missing dependency;
 *  - a rejected derived id is retried once with a short provider-safe id,
 *    with the job id still carried in params;
 *  - an over-long job id derives a bounded hash id up front (#2065
 *    remainder), so the fallback fires only when the provider rejects
 *    an id — the long-id case no longer reaches it;
 *  - an existing instance is still adopted instead of duplicated;
 *  - a genuine failure preserves the original provider error.
