# AI Multi-Agent Assistant — Cloudflare Agents SDK

An enterprise multi-agent assistant built with the Cloudflare Agents SDK, Workers AI, and Cloudflare AI Search. Features an **LLM Judge** router, specialized sub-agent tools (RAG Search, Payment Intent Drafting, Task Drafting, and Durable SQLite Memory), streaming WebSocket responses, and a read-only **Natural Language Query (NLQ)** analytics engine.

## Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** | Coordinates specialized sub-agent tools dynamically based on user intent |
| **LLM Judge & Router** | Classifies user intent (`search`, `payments`, `tasks`, `memory`, `general`) with confidence scoring, and evaluates response quality/safety in real-time |
| **Knowledge Base Search** | RAG retrieval from Cloudflare AI Search with citation metadata |
| **Safe Payment Drafting** | Drafts charges, refunds, and invoices with human-in-the-loop confirmation guardrails; never executes unverified money movement |
| **Task Management** | Proposes and organizes actionable tasks with priorities and deadlines |
| **Durable SQLite Memory** | Key-value fact vault persisted natively inside Durable Object SQLite storage across sessions |
| **Read-Only NLQ Engine** | Converts natural language analytics queries into parameter-bound SQLite queries over conversation transcripts |
| **Cross-Channel Trading Research** | Export loaded E*TRADE, Yahoo Finance, and options research data, screen evaluations, strategy evaluations, and recommendations as `.xlsx`; email workbooks, submit NLQ through Slack or voice, and publish signed recommendation reports to the configured webhook |
| **Enterprise Security** | Constant-time HMAC OAuth state verification with replay protection, Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) origin validation, and XSS-safe user script injection |

## Setup & Deployment

### Shared NLQ channel routing

Web chat (`/api/nlq`), Slack messages, voice transcripts, and inbound email use the same NLQ planner and executor. A Slack message can request an email copy by including an explicit recipient, for example `@ETradeAgent screen stocks; email results to analyst@example.com`. Slack replies in the originating channel/thread; when configured, the same structured result is also sent to `OUTBOUND_WEBHOOK_URL` with an HMAC signature. State-changing order actions are not copied to these report destinations.

Signed external NLQ requests can POST JSON to `/nlq/webhook` with an `X-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>` header computed as HMAC-SHA256 over the exact request body using `INBOUND_NLQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:

```json
{ "query": "list all strategies evaluated for NVDA bullish target $260", "emailTo": "analyst@example.com", "timestamp": "2026-10-03T15:00:00.000Z" }
```

Sign the exact JSON request body with HMAC-SHA256 and send its hex digest as `X-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>`. The signed `timestamp` must be within five minutes of receipt. `emailTo` is optional and must be supplied explicitly. Webhook requests receive the shared NLQ result as JSON; email delivery requires the existing Cloudflare `EMAIL` binding.

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets
Set the following in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API Token with Workers, Routes, and DNS Edit permissions |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Cloudflare Account ID |
| `GH_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth App Client ID |
| `GH_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth App Client Secret |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Application URL (e.g. `https://agent.openaimp.com`) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | 32-byte hex secret (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |

### 2. GitHub OAuth App Configuration
In GitHub Developer Settings:
- **Homepage URL**: `https://<your-worker-domain>`
- **Callback URL**: `https://<your-worker-domain>/auth/callback`

### 3. Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Starts Vite dev server for frontend
npx wrangler dev   # Runs Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects locally
```

Create a `.dev.vars` file for local development:
```ini
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
```

### 4. Build & Typecheck
```bash
npm run typecheck  # Validates TypeScript types (0 errors)
npm run build      # Bundles production React app with Vite
npm run check      # Runs both typecheck and build
```
